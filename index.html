<!-- =================== OUTLINE ==================== -->
<section>
<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
<p>
This research investigates intersections between <em>dual citizenship, lobbying influence, and legislative policy formation</em> within U.S. and international frameworks. 
It evaluates how transnational affiliations and economic interests shape governance through data analysis, historical comparison, and machine-readable transparency tools.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>2. Introduction & Rationale</h2>
<p>
Dual citizenship in positions of political or economic authority raises questions of loyalty, disclosure, and transnational influence. 
This study builds a reproducible, open-source framework to measure how these affiliations correlate with voting records, lobbying expenditures, and legislative sponsorship patterns.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. Literature Review</h2>
<p>
Surveys prior research on lobbying transparency (FARA, OpenSecrets), comparative citizenship studies, and post-Cold-War policy influence.
Integrates political theory (Habermas, Dahl), legal precedent (Foreign Agents Registration Act, 1938), and sociological perspectives on globalization and elite networks.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>4. Research Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>How does dual citizenship correlate with legislative or lobbying behavior in key sectors (defense, energy, real estate)?</li>
<li>Are patterns of policy sponsorship statistically linked to foreign economic networks?</li>
<li>Can open-data architectures improve accountability and disclosure standards?</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>5. Hypotheses</h2>
<ol>
<li>Dual citizenship is overrepresented in lobbying sectors involving international contracts.</li>
<li>Data transparency correlates inversely with the complexity of foreign influence structures.</li>
<li>Legislative openness and AI-driven public datasets can improve public trust metrics.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h2>6. Methodology</h2>
<p>
Combines mixed-method approaches:
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> Python scripts scrape and correlate legislative records (GovTrack, Congress.gov) with corporate entities (SEC, FARA, ProPublica).</li>
<li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> Document analysis of testimonies, lobbying disclosures, and case-law interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Ethnographic:</strong> Semi-structured interviews with policy scholars, journalists, and lobbyists under IRB-approved consent.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>7. Data Architecture</h2>
<p>
Implements modular datasets:
<pre>
data_raw/        # Source files (legislation, lobbying, registries)
data_processed/  # Cleaned, normalized records
analysis/        # Jupyter or script-driven analysis
outputs/         # Tables, graphs, and reports
</pre>
Each record includes metadata, provenance, and authenticity classification (verified, satire, propaganda).
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>8. Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p>
Complies with APA-7 and IRB standards.  
No personally identifiable information (PII) or non-public data are published.  
Analyses focus on structural influence — not individual moral evaluation.  
Sources are cited with access dates, and scripts are reproducible and idempotent.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>9. Analytical Framework</h2>
<p>
Uses a triangulated model:
<ul>
<li><strong>Structural:</strong> Data-driven mapping of citizenship and lobbying overlaps.</li>
<li><strong>Relational:</strong> Network graphs of organizations, donors, and policy sponsors.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal:</strong> Timeline analysis of legislative votes and foreign investments.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>10. Findings (Projected)</h2>
<p>
Expected outcomes include identification of high-frequency co-occurrences between dual citizenship records and specific policy categories.
Machine-learning clustering may reveal transnational legislative patterns previously obscured by manual disclosure filings.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>11. Discussion</h2>
<p>
Explores implications for national sovereignty, ethics in governance, and open-data democratization.
Draws parallels with EU transparency initiatives and emerging U.N. guidelines on dual allegiance disclosure.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>12. Limitations</h2>
<p>
Data incompleteness, underreporting in FARA filings, and classification bias may constrain inference strength.  
Ethical limitations prevent intrusive investigation beyond verified public records.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>13. Future Work</h2>
<p>
Integrate blockchain-based data provenance (TitleChain model).  
Extend dataset coverage to OECD member states.  
Develop visualization APIs for civic-tech developers and journalists.
</p>
