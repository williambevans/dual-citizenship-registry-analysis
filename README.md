## 1. Abstract
This research investigates intersections between *dual citizenship, lobbying influence, and legislative policy formation* within U.S. and international frameworks.  
It evaluates how transnational affiliations and economic interests shape governance through data analysis, historical comparison, and machine-readable transparency tools.

---

## 2. Introduction & Rationale
Dual citizenship in positions of political or economic authority raises questions of loyalty, disclosure, and transnational influence.  
This study builds a reproducible, open-source framework to measure how these affiliations correlate with voting records, lobbying expenditures, and legislative sponsorship patterns.

---

## 3. Literature Review
Surveys prior research on lobbying transparency (FARA, OpenSecrets), comparative citizenship studies, and post-Cold-War policy influence.  
Integrates political theory (Habermas, Dahl), legal precedent (FARA 1938), and sociological perspectives on globalization and elite networks.

---

## 4. Research Questions
- How does dual citizenship correlate with legislative or lobbying behavior in key sectors (defense, energy, real estate)?  
- Are patterns of policy sponsorship statistically linked to foreign economic networks?  
- Can open-data architectures improve accountability and disclosure standards?

---

## 5. Hypotheses
1. Dual citizenship is over-represented in lobbying sectors involving international contracts.  
2. Data transparency correlates inversely with the complexity of foreign-influence structures.  
3. Legislative openness and AI-driven public datasets can improve public-trust metrics.

---

## 6. Methodology
Mixed-method approach:
- **Quantitative:** Python scripts scrape and correlate legislative records (GovTrack, Congress.gov) with corporate entities (SEC, FARA, ProPublica).  
- **Qualitative:** Document analysis of testimonies, lobbying disclosures, and case-law interpretations.  
- **Ethnographic:** Semi-structured interviews with policy scholars, journalists, and lobbyists under IRB-approved consent.

---

## 7. Data Architecture
Each record includes metadata, provenance, and authenticity classification (verified, satire, propaganda).

---

## 8. Ethical Considerations
Complies with APA-7 and IRB standards.  
No personally identifiable information (PII) or non-public data are published.  
Analyses focus on structural influence ‚Äî not individual moral evaluation.  
Sources are cited with access dates; scripts are reproducible and idempotent.

---

## 9. Analytical Framework
Triangulated model:
- **Structural:** Data-driven mapping of citizenship and lobbying overlaps  
- **Relational:** Network graphs of organizations, donors, and policy sponsors  
- **Temporal:** Timeline analysis of legislative votes and foreign investments

---

## 10. Findings (Projected)
Expected outcomes include identification of high-frequency co-occurrences between dual-citizenship records and specific policy categories.  
Machine-learning clustering may reveal transnational legislative patterns previously obscured by manual disclosure filings.

---

## 11. Discussion
Explores implications for national sovereignty, ethics in governance, and open-data democratization.  
Draws parallels with EU transparency initiatives and emerging U.N. guidelines on dual-allegiance disclosure.

---

## 12. Limitations
Data incompleteness, under-reporting in FARA filings, and classification bias may constrain inference strength.  
Ethical limits prevent intrusive investigation beyond verified public records.

---

## 13. Future Work
- Integrate blockchain-based data provenance (TitleChain model).  
- Extend dataset coverage to OECD member states.  
- Develop visualization APIs for civic-tech developers and journalists.
