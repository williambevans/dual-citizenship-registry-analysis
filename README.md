## 1. Abstract
This research investigates intersections between *dual citizenship, lobbying influence, and legislative policy formation* within U.S. and international frameworks.  
It evaluates how transnational affiliations and economic interests shape governance through data analysis, historical comparison, and machine-readable transparency tools.

---

## 2. Introduction & Rationale
Dual citizenship in positions of political or economic authority raises questions of loyalty, disclosure, and transnational influence.  
This study builds a reproducible, open-source framework to measure how these affiliations correlate with voting records, lobbying expenditures, and legislative sponsorship patterns.

---

## 3. Literature Review
Surveys prior research on lobbying transparency (FARA, OpenSecrets), comparative citizenship studies, and post-Cold-War policy influence.  
Integrates political theory (Habermas, Dahl), legal precedent (FARA 1938), and sociological perspectives on globalization and elite networks.

---

## 4. Research Questions
- How does dual citizenship correlate with legislative or lobbying behavior in key sectors (defense, energy, real estate)?  
- Are patterns of policy sponsorship statistically linked to foreign economic networks?  
- Can open-data architectures improve accountability and disclosure standards?

---

## 5. Hypotheses
1. Dual citizenship is over-represented in lobbying sectors involving international contracts.  
2. Data transparency correlates inversely with the complexity of foreign-influence structures.  
3. Legislative openness and AI-driven public datasets can improve public-trust metrics.

---

## 6. Methodology
Mixed-method approach:
- **Quantitative:** Python scripts scrape and correlate legislative records (GovTrack, Congress.gov) with corporate entities (SEC, FARA, ProPublica).  
- **Qualitative:** Document analysis of testimonies, lobbying disclosures, and case-law interpretations.  
- **Ethnographic:** Semi-structured interviews with policy scholars, journalists, and lobbyists under IRB-approved consent.
